# DVT Weather :partly_sunny:

An Android weather application implemented using the MVVM pattern and clean architecture, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt, Kotlin Flows, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin DSL and some other libraries from the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) . DVT Weather fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide real time weather information. It also makes use of the [Algolia Instant Search](https://www.algolia.com/products/instantsearch/) service which enables you search for weather conditions of various locations.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates separation of different layers of the application.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - A modern toolkit for building native Android UI
* [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - An alternative syntax for writing Gradle build scripts using Kotlin. 
* [Version Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) - A scalable way of maintaining dependencies and plugins in a multi-module project.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#:~:text=StateFlow%20is%20a%20state%2Dholder,property%20of%20the%20MutableStateFlow%20class) to enable flows to emit updated state and emit values to multiple consumers optimally.
* [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) to emit a stream of data with multiple values sequentially.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Algolia Search API - Android](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/android/) to quickly and seamlessly implement search within the application.
* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to manage Android background jobs.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Preferences](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings) to create interactive settings screens.
* [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics) for realtime crash reporting and tracking stability issues that erode app quality.

## Installation
DVT Weather requires a minimum API level of 24. Clone the repository. You will need an API key i.e. `API_KEY` from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to request data. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. Also, you will need to create an app on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/).

Generate a search only API key i.e. `ALGOLIA_API_KEY`, the APP ID i.e. `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` for the app you created and then create an [Index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/) under that app, you will need the index name i.e. `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME` to setup the search functionality in this application. You can populate the index with records from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o-btuAm1bxAwKzd41DP8-1mToTc1QQz-/view?usp=sharing).

Each record follows this structure:

````JSON
{
    "objectID": "ffe74e4cdddbc_dashboard_generated_id",
    "country": "Kenya",
    "geonameid": 47439340,
    "name": "Westlands",
    "subcountry": "Nairobi"
}
  
````

In your project's root directory, inside the `local.properties` file (create one if unavailable) include the following lines:

````properties
BASE_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
ALGOLIA_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
ALGOLIA_APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME = "YOUR_INDEX_NAME"
SONAR_TOKEN = "YOUR_SONARQUBE_TOKEN"
SONAR_HOST_URL = "http://localhost:9000"

````

## CI/CD

[Github Actions](https://github.com/TomMunyiri/DVTWeatherApp/actions) is used for CI/CD. The project contains the following workflows:
* [Android Build](https://github.com/TomMunyiri/DVTWeatherApp/blob/main/.github/workflows/android_build.yml) - Runs tests, builds the project, and generates an apk. 
* [Ktlint](https://github.com/TomMunyiri/DVTWeatherApp/blob/main/.github/workflows/klint.yml) - Does lint checking using the [ktlint](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) gradle plugin.
* [SonarQube Analysis](https://github.com/TomMunyiri/DVTWeatherApp/blob/main/.github/workflows/sonarqube_analysis.yml) - Does static code analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells.

## Setting up SonarQube locally

SonarQube is integrated into the project for static code analysis. It helps detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells. 
* ### Setup
A local installation of SonarQube server is needed in order to run static code analysis.
For more information on how to setup SonarQube, please read [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/try-out-sonarqube/?_gl=1*1sri4ay*_gcl_au*MjA2NDUyNDAwOC4xNzA1OTk5NjU0*_ga*MTIzODg3MzguMTcwNTk5OTY1NA..*_ga_9JZ0GZ5TC6*MTcwNTk5OTY1NC4xLjEuMTcwNjAxNDc2NS4xMS4wLjA.) .
As of 25th Jan 2023, SonarQube required Java 17 or lower to run properly. Please make sure you have Java 17 or lower installed.
To set the default JDK on mac, use `export JAVA_HOME='/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17'`
* ### Start SonarQube 
To start sonar qube local instance, run `/opt/sonarqube/bin/macosx-universal-64/sonar.sh console`. Replace `macosx-universal-64` with your OS version. If not sure of your OS version, `cd` into `/opt/sonarqube/bin/` and then `ls`
* ### Run SonarQube
To run a static code analysis on the project using SonarQube, navigate to the project's root directory and execute `./gradlew sonarqube -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000` .
Check the results on (http://localhost:9000) after the analysis is complete.
